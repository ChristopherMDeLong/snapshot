Snapshot

Author: Chris DeLong

In the restaurant industry only about 25 percent of businesses take a regular inventory,
and if asked what their food cost was running the majority would not have an accurate
answer. Inventory is time consuming and tracking cross utilized items can become very
difficult. Since restaurants deal with a perishable product this program assumes that
inventory is going to remain at a stable level. By tracking sales, food costs, liquor
costs and labor costs on a weekly basis the user can make sure operating expenses are
staying with in a reasonable range. Also it reaches out to Yelp to pull in the reviews
for that week to see how the business is being viewed in the public eye. This provides
a weekly snapshot showing how the business is both being perceived by the public and
operating.
